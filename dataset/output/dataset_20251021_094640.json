  "profile": "Emma is a 35-year-old freelance graphic designer and single mother of a 7-year-old daughter. She works from home, juggling client projects with school runs and childcare. Her schedule is irregular - sometimes working late into the night to meet deadlines, other times taking afternoon breaks to pick up her daughter. Emma tries to maintain a yoga routine three times per week but often skips it when busy. She has a supportive network of other parents she connects with at school and occasional video calls with her sister abroad. Sleep is inconsistent, averaging 6 hours per night, and she relies on coffee throughout the day. Emma uses a smartwatch mainly to track steps and set reminders for picking up her daughter.",
