  "profile": "James is a 45-year-old warehouse supervisor working the evening shift (2 PM - 10 PM) at a distribution center. He's been in this role for 15 years and is on his feet most of the day, walking between storage areas and loading docks. James wakes up around 10 AM, has a late breakfast, and goes to the gym for 30 minutes before work. He's trying to lose weight and monitors his activity with a fitness tracker. After work, he unwinds by watching TV or playing video games until 1-2 AM, which disrupts his sleep schedule. James has limited social interaction during the week due to his shift, but bowls in a league on Sunday mornings and has dinner with his brother's family once a week. He struggles with maintaining a healthy diet, often eating fast food during his work break.",
